# Demo_Concurrent_API_Calls
Demonstrate calling multiple APIs concurrently.
I was asked to demonstrate how to call multiple APIs concurrently in C#. To do this I created an MVC server providing a REST API to get and post resources "2" and "3" as the downstream requests.
Resource "1" is the demonstration as an API accessible via Swagger UI.
